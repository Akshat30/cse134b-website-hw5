              recipes and images through voice input.

            <h3>project 3: verum large language model text analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This project allows a given user to choose a famous political
              speech, or input their own, and receive a detailed analysis of it.
              This includes a general analysis, specific fact checking, an
              unbiased summary, and more. It extracts the text from a given
              article, uses the Google API to receive additional information,
              summarizes the text, and uses OpenAI's LLM endpoints to receive an
              analysis.
            </p>

              here is a cool piece of code from this project:
              <br />
            </p>
            <pre>
<code>print("Enter the link to a transcript/article:")
url = input()
load_dotenv()
extractor_api_key = os.getenv("EXTRACTOR_API_KEY")
ex = Extractor(extractor_api_key)
transcript = ex.getTranscript(url)</code>
        </pre>
            <p>
              This code uses a third party extractor library to extract the text
              from a given link article. This was the best free api we could
              find for this hackathon project.

              This project was built for fun, for me to be able to learn how to
              use Next.js. It displays lots of information regarding my Spotify
              profile! Or for any profile that signs in.
